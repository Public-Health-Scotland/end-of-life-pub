### About this release

This release by the Information Services Division provides information on the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life. Data are presented by financial year from `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r max(basefile$fy)`, by NHS Board, Health and Social Care Partnership of residence and for Scotland. 

`r if_else(pub_type == "update", glue("This publication is an update to the {format(last_pub_date, '%B %Y')} publication. Figures for {latest$fy} have been updated to reflect improved levels of completeness of hospital data and finalised deaths data for {substr(latest$fy, 1, 4)}. "), "")`Note that `r if_else(pub_type == "provisional", "hospital data and", "")` National Records of Scotland deaths data are provisional for `r max(basefile$fy)`. `r if_else(pub_type == "provisional", glue("This publication will be updated in {next_pub_date} with final figures. Figures for the latest year should therefore be treated with caution as there could be an undercount of hospital admissions, particularly for people who died in the last three months of the year.  This is not expected to have a large impact on these published figures when they are revised in subsequent updates."), "")`

### Main Points

* In `r latest$fy`, there were `r latest$deaths` deaths in Scotland excluding those where an external cause of death was recorded (including falls).  For these individuals, `r latest$qom`% of their last six months of life was spent either at home or in a community setting, with the remaining `r latest$qom_hosp`% spent in hospital. This is equivalent to an average of `r if(latest$hosp < 10){as.character(as.english(latest$hosp))}else{latest$hosp}` days in hospital in the six months prior to death.

* Over the past `r as.character(as.english(year(end_date) - year(start_date)))` years, the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting has gradually increased from `r summarise_data(basefile, include_years = "first") %>% pull(qom)`% in `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$qom`% in `r latest$fy`.

* In `r latest$fy`, `r max_sex`s aged 85 and older spent a higher percentage of their last six months of life in the community (`r max(sex$qom)`%) compared to `r if_else(max_sex == "female", "male", "female")`s (`r min(sex$qom)`%); this equates to `r max_sex`s spending, on average an extra `r as.character(day_diff(max(sex$qom), min(sex$qom)))` days in the community in their last six months of life.


### Background

This Quality Outcome Measure focuses on measuring the impact of the Scottish Government’s [“Strategic Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life Care”](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00491388.pdf) which has one of its commitments to “support improvements in the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data and evidence relating to needs, provision, activity, indicators and outcomes in respect of palliative and end of life care”. This strategic framework superseded [“Living and Dying Well: A National Action Plan for Palliative and End of Life in Scotland”](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/239823/0066155.pdf). 

The percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting towards the end of life provides a high level indication of progress in implementation of the strategic framework for action. This is inferred by measuring the amount of time spent in a hospital setting during the last months of life (using hospital admissions data) and from this estimating the time spent at home or in a community setting.
