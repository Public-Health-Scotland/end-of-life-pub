# About this release

This release by Public Health Scotland provides information on the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life. Data are presented by financial year from `r min(basefile$fy)` through to `r max(basefile$fy)`, by NHS Board, Health and Social Care Partnership of residence and for Scotland. The figures presented for financial year `r max(basefile$fy)` are provisional. Please see [Background](#Background) for more information. 

# Main Points

* In financial year `r latest$fy`, there were `r latest$deaths` deaths in Scotland, including falls, but excluding other external causes of death.  For these individuals, `r latest$qom`% of their last six months of life was spent either at home or in a community setting, with the remaining `r latest$qom_hosp`% spent in hospital. This is equivalent to an average of `r if(latest$hosp < 10){as.character(as.english(latest$hosp))}else{latest$hosp}` days in hospital in the six months prior to death.

* Over the past `r as.character(as.english(year(end_date) - year(start_date)))` years, the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life has gradually increased from `r summarise_data(basefile, include_years = "first") %>% pull(qom)`% in financial year `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$qom`% in `r latest$fy`.


<Div custom-style = "Chart Title">**Percentage of last six months of life spent at home or in a community setting;**</div>
<Div custom-style = "Chart Title">**`r min(basefile$fy)` - `r max(basefile$fy)`^1,2^**</div>
![`r alt_text`](figures/figure-1-summary.png) <br>

<div custom-style = "Normal_Notes">
1. Figures for `r latest$fy` are provisional.
2. The increase in 2020/21 is likely due to the impact of COVID-19 on hospital stays.
</div>


* In `r latest$fy`, `r max_sex`s aged 85 and older spent a higher percentage of their last six months of life in the community (`r max(sex$qom)`%) compared to `r if_else(max_sex == "female", "male", "female")`s (`r min(sex$qom)`%); this equates to `r max_sex`s spending, on average an extra `r as.character(day_diff(max(sex$qom), min(sex$qom)))` days in the community in their last six months of life.


# Background

This Quality Outcome Measure focuses on measuring the impact of the Scottish Government’s [“Strategic Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life Care”](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00491388.pdf) which has one of its commitments to “support improvements in the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data and evidence relating to needs, provision, activity, indicators and outcomes in respect of palliative and end of life care”. This strategic framework superseded [“Living and Dying Well: A National Action Plan for Palliative and End of Life in Scotland”](https://lx.iriss.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/living%20and%20dying.pdf). 

The percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting towards the end of life provides a high level indication of progress in implementation of the strategic framework for action. This is inferred by measuring the amount of time spent in a hospital setting during the last months of life (using hospital admissions data) and from this estimating the time spent at home or in a community setting.
