# About this release

This release by Public Health Scotland (PHS) provides information on the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life. Data is presented by financial year from `r min(basefile$fy)` through to `r max(basefile$fy)`, by NHS Board, Health and Social Care Partnership of residence and for Scotland. The figures presented for financial year `r max(basefile$fy)` are provisional.

# Main points
</div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
In `r latest$fy`, there were `r latest$deaths` deaths in Scotland. This includes falls but excludes people who died from other external causes. For these individuals, `r latest$qom`% of their last six months of life was spent either at home or in a community setting, with the remaining `r latest$qom_hosp`% spent in hospital. This is equivalent to an average of `r if(latest$hosp < 10){as.character(as.english(latest$hosp))}else{latest$hosp}` days in hospital in the six months prior to death, an `r if (trend[10,7] < trend[9,7]){"decrease"}else{"increase"}` of `r if(trend[10,7] < trend[9,7]){trend[9,7] - trend[10,7]}else{trend[10,7] - trend[9,7]}` days from `r trend[9,1]`.

The trend of the percentage of time spent at home or in the community in `r latest$fy` (`r latest$qom`%) was slightly lower than 2020/21 (`r trend$qom[trend$fy=="2020/21"]`%) and 2021/22 (`r trend$qom[trend$fy=="2021/22"]`%) but remains higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic.
On average, an extra `r if(trend[10,7] < trend[1,7]){trend[1,7] - trend[10,7]}else{trend[10,7] - trend[1,7]}` days within the last six months of life was spent at home or in a community setting in `r max(trend$fy)` compared to `r min(trend$fy)`. The length of hospital stays in 2020/21 and 2021/22 are likely to have been impacted by the measures in place at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
In `r latest$fy`, males and females spent on average a similar proportion of their last six months of life in the community. This varies by age group with males (XX.X%) aged 0-54 spending a higher(lower?) proportion of their last six months of life in the community than females (XX.X%); an average of X days more(less?) for males. YOU NEED TO MANUALLY FIND THE VALUES ON THE TABLE. Whereas for those aged 85 and over, `r max_sex` (`r max(sex$qom)`%) spent a slightly higher proportion of their last six months of life in the community than `r if_else(max_sex == "women", "men", "women")` (`r min(sex$qom)`%); an average of `r as.character(day_diff(max(sex$qom), min(sex$qom)))` days more for `r max_sex`.

# Background
</div>
This Quality Outcome is a measure of the impact of the Scottish Government’s [“Strategic Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life Care”](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00491388.pdf).

The percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting towards the end of life provides a high level indication of progress made on the strategic framework for action. This is inferred by measuring the amount of time spent in a hospital during the last six months of life and thus using this information to estimate the time spent at home or in a community setting.
It is estimated that hospital data for Scotland are XX% complete for `r latest$fy`.
