<Div custom-style = "Heading 1">Introduction</div>

The [NHS Healthcare Quality Strategy](https://www.gov.scot/publications/healthcare-quality-strategy-nhsscotland/) was launched in May 2010 by the Scottish Government with the aim of delivering high quality healthcare services to the people of Scotland. A direct action identified by the Quality Strategy was to develop a [Quality Measurement Framework](https://www.gov.scot/publications/healthcare-quality-strategy-nhsscotland/pages/4/) supporting a number of Quality Outcome Measures (QOMs). These measures cover a range of healthcare topics including; care experience, healthcare acquired infections, hospital mortality rates and end of life care.

This release by Public Health Scotland presents information in support of the objectives set out in the December 2015 [Strategic Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life Care](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00491388.pdf) which has one of its commitments to “support improvements in the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data and evidence relating to needs, provision, activity, indicators and outcomes in respect of palliative and end of life care”. This strategic framework superseded [Living and Dying Well: A National Action Plan for Palliative and End of Life in Scotland](https://lx.iriss.org.uk/sites/default/files/resources/living%20and%20dying.pdf). 

Ideally, the measure would relate directly to an individual’s preferred place of care at the end of their life. However, there are challenges around capturing this information. There is no national and systematic data recorded on a person’s preferred place of care at the end of life and this publication uses instead the following surrogate measure: *“Percentage of last six months spent at home or in a community setting”*. Although this is not a direct measure of compliance with an individual’s preferred place of death, it can serve to provide a broad indication of progress in implementing the strategic framework for action. 

More recently in December 2016 the [Health and Social Care Delivery Plan](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0051/00511950.pdf) was launched, which reinforces key actions and services to respond to palliative and end of life care needs among other health and social care priorities.

Please note that hospital data and National Records of Scotland deaths data are provisional for `r latest$fy`.  See [Appendix 2](#appendix-2---background-information) for more information.

<Div custom-style = "Heading 1">Main Points</div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
In `r latest$fy`, there were `r latest$deaths` deaths in Scotland, including falls (but excluding people who died from other external causes). For these individuals, `r latest$qom`% of their last six months of life was spent either at home or in a community setting, with the remaining `r latest$qom_hosp`% spent in hospital. This is equivalent to an average of `r if(latest$hosp < 10){as.character(as.english(latest$hosp))}else{latest$hosp}` days in hospital in the six months prior to death.
</div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
The length of hospital stays in 2020/21 and `r latest$fy` are likely to have been impacted by measures in place at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be an underlying reason for the larger increase in the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting between 2019/20 and 2020/21, compared to previous years, (increasing from `r trend$qom[trend$fy=="2019/20"]`% in 2019/20 to `r trend$qom[trend$fy=="2020/21"]`% in 2020/21). Since then there has been a reduction to `r latest$qom`% in `r latest$fy`.
</div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
For people aged 85 and over in `r latest$fy`,  a slightly higher proportion of their last six months of 
life was spent in the community by `r max_sex` than by `r if_else(max_sex == "women", "men", "women")` (`r max(sex$qom)`% and `r min(sex$qom)`%, respectively) – an average of `r as.character(day_diff(max(sex$qom), min(sex$qom)))` days more for `r max_sex`.
</div>

\newpage

<Div custom-style = "Heading 1">Results and Commentary</div>

In financial year `r latest$fy`, the estimated `r latest$deaths` residents of Scotland who died spent on average `r latest$qom`% of their last six months of life either at home or in the community (Table 1 of the [data tables](`r pub_date_link`)) and `r latest$qom_hosp`% of their last six months of life was spent in hospital (Figure 1). This is equivalent to each individual spending an average of `r if(latest$hosp < 10){as.character(as.english(latest$hosp))}else{latest$hosp}` days in hospital in the six months prior to their death, an increase of 2 days from 2020/21.

The length of hospital stays in 2020/21 and 2021/22 are likely to have been impacted by the measures in place at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be an underlying reason for a marked increase in the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting between 2019/20 and 2020/21, increasing from 88.4% in 2019/20 to 90.4% in 2020/21, and the subsequent reduction to 89.8% in 2021/22.

Generally, the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life has increased gradually over the last decade – `r basefile %>% summarise_data(include_years = "first") %>% pull(qom)`% in `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$qom`% in `r latest$fy`. This equates to, on average, an extra `r day_diff(basefile %>% summarise_data(include_years = "first") %>% pull(qom), latest$qom)` days within the last six months of life being spent at home or in a community setting in `r latest$fy` compared to `r min(basefile$fy)` (see Figure 1 below or [Appendix 1](#appendix-1---trend-data)).

<Div custom-style = "Heading 2">NHS Board of Residence</div>
Figure 2 shows the variation in the percentage of time spent at home or in the community in the last six months of life across Scotland by NHS Board. 

The NHS Board where residents spent the highest percentage of time in their last six months of life at home or in the community was `r max_hb$hb` where on average `r max_hb$qom`% of an individual’s last six months of life was spent at home or in a community setting and `r max_hb$qom_hosp`% in hospital. On average, this equates to approximately `r if(max_hb$hosp < 10){as.character(as.english(max_hb$hosp))}else{max_hb$hosp}` days spent in a hospital setting within the last six months of life. 

The NHS Board with the lowest percentage of time on average spent at home or in a community setting in their last six months of life was `r min_hb$hb` where `r min_hb$qom`% of an individual’s last six months of life was spent at home or in a community setting and `r min_hb$qom_hosp`% in hospital. This equates to approximately `r if(min_hb$hosp < 10){as.character(as.english(min_hb$hosp))}else{min_hb$hosp}` days spent in a hospital setting within the last six months of life. The variation in percentages across Scotland could be affected by the age profile and rurality of the different health boards.

Table 2 shows that there is some variation between Partnerships with the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting ranging from `r min_hscp$qom`% (`r min_hscp$hscp`) to `r max_hscp$qom`% (`r max_hscp$hscp`). The range, albeit small, could be due to a number of factors including differences in age profile and urban/rural effects.

<br>

The trend in the percentage of the last six months of life spent at home or in a community setting over the past `r trend_length` years for Health and Social Care Partnerships is presented in graphical format in Figure A1.2 (see [Appendix 1](#appendix-1---trend-data)) and the corresponding data can be found in Table 2 of the [data tables](`r pub_date_link`).

<Div custom-style = "Heading 2">Age and Sex</div>
Figure 3 below presents the percentage of time spent at home or in the community in the last six months by age group and sex (Table 3 of the [data tables](`r pub_date_link`)). In `r latest$fy`, for all ages combined there was a similar percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting for females (`r allages %>% filter(sex == "Female") %>% pull(qom)`%) and males (`r allages %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>% pull(qom)`%). For individuals aged 85 years and over, `r max_old`s (`r max(old$qom)`%) spent a higher percentage of their last six months of life at home or in the community compared to `r min_old`s (`r min(old$qom)`%); this equates to `r max_old`s spending, on average, an extra `r as.character(day_diff(max(old$qom), min(old$qom)))` days in the community. In the youngest age group (0-54 years), `r max_young`s (`r max(young$qom)`%) spent a higher percentage of their last six months of life at home or in the community compared to `r min_young`s (`r min(young$qom)`%); this equates to, on average, an extra `r as.character(day_diff(max(young$qom), min(young$qom)))` days at home or in the community.

<Div custom-style = "Heading 2">Deprivation</div>
The percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life by deprivation is shown in Figure 4 (Table 4 of the [data tables](`r pub_date_link`)). Deprivation category has been assigned using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. At a Scotland level approximately 20% of the population are within each deprivation quintile with deprivation category 1 relating to the most deprived areas and deprivation category 5 to the least deprived areas. See the [Glossary](#Glossary) for further information on Deprivation.

Figure 4 shows that there is little variation in the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life across the different deprivation categories. The percentages range from `r min(simd$qom)`% (deprivation category `r min_simd`) to `r max(simd$qom)`% (deprivation category `r max_simd`). The trend over time by deprivation category is presented in graphical format in Figure A1.3 (see [Appendix 1](#appendix-1---trend-data)) and the corresponding data can be found in Table 4 of the [data tables](`r pub_date_link`). All deprivation categories show a similar trend over time, with a small increase in the percentage of time in the last six months spent at home or in the community.

The percentage of the last six months of life spent at home or in the community ranged from `r min(ur$qom)`% for residents in `r min_ur` to `r max(ur$qom)`% for residents from `r max_ur` (Figure 5; Table 5 of the [data tables](`r pub_date_link`)). Individuals living in `r max_ur` spent, on average, approximately `r as.character(day_diff(max(ur$qom), min(ur$qom)))` extra days at home or in a community setting in the last six months of life compared to those living in `r min_ur`.

Trend data on the percentage of the last six months of life spent at home or in a community setting by Urban/Rural classification are presented in graphical format in Figure A1.4 (see [Appendix 1](#appendix-1---trend-data)).


<Div custom-style = "Heading 1">Glossary</div>

**Palliative Care**

Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness. This is achieved through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems.

**End of Life**

End of Life Care is that part of palliative care which should follow from the diagnosis of a person entering the process of dying, whether or not he or she is already in receipt of palliative care. This phase could vary between weeks, days or hours in the context of different disease trajectories. There can be uncertainty involved in identifying when someone might be expected to die – illness can be unpredictable, and changes can occur suddenly and unexpectedly.

**Bed Day**

Unit of measurement relating to an overnight stay in an inpatient hospital bed.

**Time spent in a hospital setting**

Time spent in acute, community or psychiatric hospitals. Refers to all hospital bed days calculated from SMR01 records (Acute and Geriatric Long Stay specialties) and SMR04 records (Mental Health specialties).

**Deprivation (SIMD)**

SIMD- Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. Deprivation for individuals is estimated from aggregate data derived from the census and other routine sources. These are used to estimate the deprivation of small geographical areas. Data in this report are analysed by the ‘Scotland level’ Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation population weighted quintiles. Each quintile consists of approximately 20% of the population living in Scotland, with deprivation quintile 1 indicating the 20% of the population living in the most deprived areas and deprivation quintile 5 the 20% of the population living in the least deprived areas.

**Data Zone**

The Scottish Government introduced Data Zones in 2004 as their preferred small area geography. PHS has used these as a replacement for postcode sectors. Data Zones have been designed to cover the whole of Scotland, nesting within council area (also known as local authority) boundaries. Data Zones are a composite geography based on aggregates of 2001 Census output areas and originally had a population of between 500 and 1,000 people per Data Zone. Where possible, they have been made to respect physical boundaries and natural communities, have a regular shape and contain households with similar social characteristics.

**Urban/Rural Classification**

The Scottish Government Urban/Rural classification can be used to classify geographies as urban, rural or remote. Each data zone is assigned to an urban rural category based upon the location of its population weighted centroid. Further information can be found on the [Scottish Government website](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-government-urban-rural-classification-2016/pages/1/).

<Div custom-style = "Heading 2">Appendix 2 - Background Information</div>

End of life care (palliative care) is an important, integral aspect of the health care provided to those living with and dying from any advanced or progressive and life-threatening condition. 

The [NHS Healthcare Quality Strategy](https://www.gov.scot/publications/healthcare-quality-strategy-nhsscotland/) (May 2010) was launched with the aim of delivering high quality healthcare services to people in Scotland. A direct action identified by the Quality Strategy was to develop a [Quality Measurement Framework](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Policy/Quality-Strategy/Quality-Measurement-Framework) supporting a number of Quality Outcome Measures (QOMs). These measures cover a range of healthcare topics including; care experience, healthcare acquired infections, hospital mortality rates and end of life care.

The December 2015 [Strategic Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life Care](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00491388.pdf) was published to “support improvements in the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data and evidence relating to needs, provision, activity, indicators and outcomes in respect of palliative and end of life care”. This strategic framework superseded ["Living and Dying Well: A National Action Plan for Palliative and End of Life in Scotland"](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/239823/0066155.pdf). 

The December 2016 [Health and Social Care Delivery Plan](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0051/00511950.pdf) reinforces key actions and services to respond to palliative and end of life care needs among other health and social care priorities. 

This publication provides information in support of the Quality Measurement Framework to develop Quality Outcome Measure 10: ‘The percentage of last six months of life spent at home or in a community setting’.

The proportion of time spent at home or in a community setting towards the end of life provides a high level indication of progress in implementation of the strategic framework for action. This is inferred by measuring the amount of time spent in a hospital setting during the last months of life (using hospital admissions data) and from this estimating the time spent at home or in a community setting.

It is envisaged that an increase in this measure will reflect both quality and value through more effective, person centred and efficient end of life care with people being better able to be cared for at home or closer to home with a planned approach to end of life care resulting in less time in a hospital setting. 

Over time, an increase in the proportion of time spent at home / in a community setting at the end of life may indicate an improvement in the quality and efficiency of palliative care. This increase would be expected in the medium to long term as a result of an increase in the use of anticipatory care plans and electronic palliative care summaries. 

This measure is based on Acute Inpatient and Day Case and Geriatric Long Stay (SMR01/SMR01 GLS) and Mental Health Inpatient and Day Case (SMR04), returns covering non-obstetric hospitals in Scotland. 

<Div custom-style = "Heading 3">Data Quality and Completeness</div>

`r if_else(pub_type == "provisional", "Hospital data and ", "")`National Records of Scotland deaths data are provisional for `r latest$fy`. It is anticipated that any changes in the future are likely to have a minimal impact on the measure presented.

Estimated completeness figures for Acute Inpatient and Day Case records (SMR01) are presented in Table 3. Figures for the latest year should be treated with caution as there could be an undercount of hospital admissions, particularly for people who died in the last six months of the financial year. `r comp_appendix`

<Div custom-style = "Heading 2">Appendix 3 - Methodology</div> 

This publication includes data from financial years `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$fy` at Scotland, NHS Board and Health and Social Care Partnership level. 

<br>

<Div custom-style = "Heading 3">Calculation of Measure</div> 

Scottish residents who died between `r min(basefile$fy)` and `r latest$fy` are identified using date of death on National Records of Scotland death records. The possible number of bed days that could have been spent in hospital in a six-month period is calculated by multiplying the total number of deaths by 182.5. Patients who died where an external cause of death (e.g. unintentional injuries) is recorded on the death record have been excluded from the analysis; however patients who died where a fall is recorded are included. Patients with missing postcodes have also been excluded. 

The deaths data are linked to hospital discharge data (SMR01 and SMR04) and the actual number of bed days spent in hospital in Scotland in the six months prior to the death of each individual is calculated and added together for all individuals. This includes bed days from all acute and community hospitals, psychiatric hospitals or geriatric long stay facilities.

The percentage of time spent in hospital in the last six months of life is therefore arrived at by dividing the actual number of bed days by the possible number of bed days. The percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting is then obtained by subtracting the percentage of time spent in hospital from 100%. 

For each financial year from `r min(basefile$fy)` to `r latest$fy` this report presents the percentage of the last six months of life that was spent at home or in a community setting for patients who died within each financial year. A summary of how the measure is calculated is shown below.

<Div custom-style = "Heading 3">Revision of methodology</div>

In publications released prior to 2020, a small amount of inpatient activity located in care homes were captured as part of the 'Hospital' setting. This activity represents beds funded by the NHS which are located within a care home and affects a relatively small number of inpatient records. For publications released from 2020 onwards, these Care home activities have been excluded from our calculations for time spent in the Hospital setting and are now counted as time spent in the Community setting. The change in methodology has been implemented across all years and for all analyses presented. The impact of this change varies but, compared to previous publications, the proportion of time spent at home or in a community setting has largely remained the same or increased only slightly.

Figure A3.1 below gives a comparison of these two measures over the ten years reported. In `r latest$fy`, the percentage of time spent at home or in a community setting was `r basefile %>% mutate(los = los_old) %>% summarise_data() %>% pull(qom)`% using the previous methodology and `r latest$qom`% using the new methodology.
